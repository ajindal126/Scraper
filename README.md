# Scraper
Used for scraping all the internal links of a website.

Following steps should be implemented while running code:

install the dependencies using npm install in project folder

then run the code using node src/app.js in terminal or install nodemon(run nodemon)

Scrapping will be happening at http://localhost:8015/scrape

You will be able to see all the links in the terminal and a file will be automatically saved in project folder as Links.json after crawling is completed.
